# RedisGoogle
Redis Deployement on Google Cloud and Node Js connectivity 

Step 1: Deploy an Instance of Redis, the google's one click deployment
is very costly hence I did the Bitnami one.

Step 2: Go to Instance section in your project and click on redis-1 or
something similar there you will find the password there.
(Bitnami's official wiki has some outdated details regarding that and
hence this doc will be useful for  everyone)

Step 3: Copy the Host IP

Step 4: Go to network section by clicking on default and make changes as
suggested in Bitnami's wiki

Step 5: Make Changes to this repository

Step 6: Deploy and Run
